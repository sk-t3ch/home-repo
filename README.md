# Home Repo
This repository stores the code for creating your own home development pipeline on a Raspberry Pi.
I used a RPi 4 with 4GB RAM.

There are four blog posts:
1. [Intro (docker and git)](https://medium.com/@t3chflicks/home-devops-pipeline-a-junior-engineers-tale-1-4-336ed07a6ec0)
2. [CI (drone, gitea, traefik)](https://medium.com/@t3chflicks/home-devops-pipeline-a-junior-engineers-tale-2-4-7be3e3c292c)
3. [CD (ansible, aws)](https://medium.com/@t3chflicks/home-devops-pipeline-a-junior-engineers-tale-3-4-5f61c5245934)
4. [Monitoring (portainer)](coming-soon)

Inside the `src/` folder there is all the code required for creating your own development pipeline.
Inside the `extra/` folder there is a the code required for creating some of the images and testing.
